# Yolov5-Objects-Recognition
object recognition using Yolov5 on your own images and using Google Colab to speed up the learning process
## I am using Yolov5 shamelessly copied from ultralytics git https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
# why this ?
## the purpose is to use yolov5 to train on  google colab using our own annotated images, produce a trained model from Colab, then keep these weight files to run our own detection locally (using much humble hardware) 
## note that ultralytics have released what they call nano models (YOLOv5n and YOLOv5n6), and that could be very interesting in our onboard robotics applications. see : https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases
